            <p>
                OCR scans and identifies car license plates using ANPR. It gathers license plate information from passing cars using sophisticated 
                cameras and algorithms. ANPR improves accuracy and speed. ANPR systems that read license plates quickly and in low light are 
                more adaptable. ANPR may monitor people and capture sensitive data, raising privacy and data security issues.
